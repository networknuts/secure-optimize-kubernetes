#####
# When your pod is assigned to a node, it automatically creates an emptyDir volume. 
# The volume lives on the host, outside of the container. 
# By default, it stores data on your node’s backup mechanism (disk, network storage, SSD, etc.). 
# In part, this is why emptyDir is so beneficial to use here – 
# you don’t need to spin up additional resources to support the volume.

# All containers running in a given pod will independently read/write data to the same emptyDir volume. 
# The default mountPath for each pod on the node, has a root location of:

# /var/lib/kubelet/pods/{podid}/volumes/kubernetes.io~empty-dir/
